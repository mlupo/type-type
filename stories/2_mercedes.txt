2 MERCEDES

                                     FRANK:
   Well, we had two Mercedes, a 280SL green and 280SL red. The red one was in  
 perfect shape. We used to go joy riding, driving at night time, so we drove it
                            and drove it and drove it.

     All of a sudden, it stopped running. So we took it into the shop, they
     start taking the motor apart, this and that, and they couldn't fix it.

               After all that, they realized the car ran out of gas.

                  I don't know, if they took advantage of us... 

                       That was a wrecked car after that.
